# CITI BIKES PROJECT

PROJECT GOAL
 
 To better understand the behavior of Citi Bikeâ€™s customer base (both one-time users and subscribers) and how they use Citi Bikes.

ANALYZING AND VISUALIZING DATA

In this section, using the cleaned dataset, I was able to analyze and visualize the insights below;
1. What are the most popular pick-up locations for Citi Bike's rental?
   Top 5 pick up locations are Grove St Path, Sip Ave, Newport Path, Newark Ave, Van Vorst Park. 

2. How does the average trip duration vary across different age groups?
    75+ year olds take the longest trips on average and 65-74 take the shortest trip on average 

3. Which age group rents the most bikes?
 34-44 year olds rent the most bikes

4. How does bike rental vary across the two user groups (one-time users vs long-term subscribers) on different days of the week?
   Citi bike customer base is predominantly made up of long term subscribers. Also subscribers are more active during the week and one time users are more 
   active on weekends.

RECOMMENDATIONS

 My Recommendations would be to Install more bikes at grove st path, sip ave as these were the top 2 most popular locations and their customer base are between the ages of 35-44 so therefore advertising campaigns should target this age group.
